<h4>How and when can I return my product? </h4>
<h5>
If you are unhappy with the product that you have received for any reason you can raise a return requestwithin 15 working days from the date of receiving the order.  
Please note that we do not provide cash refunds, but we will refund the amount in the form of store credits, which can be used to purchase any product from the webstore.
<br>

<h4>How does the exchange policy work? </h4>

If the product doesn’t fit right, the product you received isn’t the one you chose or if there’s a manufacturing fault, we’ll exchange it for you. We really want you to love what you get and not be "stuck" with it. 
However, please make sure that the piece is returned to us in the condition you received it in. We will appreciate that you don’t send it to us if you wash it or use it a couple of times. Cause we won’t be able to process your request.
<br>
If you have any other questions about returns please feel free to mail us at care@miracas.com﻿﻿. Don’t forget to mention your order details.
<br>
<br>
<h4> Who bears the postal charges for the goods returned? </h4>
<h5>For most of the locations ,we provide reverse pickup facility. That way you do not need   to   pay for the courier charges.
<br>
If we are unable to arrange a reverse pickup, we will bear the cost of return shipment by crediting your account with Store Credits. (Max of 100 INR)
