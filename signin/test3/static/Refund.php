<h4>Refund Policy </h4>

<h5>
We provide fulll refund in the form of store credits , to each and every order that has been cancelled or returned. Simply no questions asked.

<br><br>
For any reason if you are not satisfied with the product, you can return the item and and opt for a refund. The refund vouchers will be credited to you as soon as we recieve the products back.
<br><br>

<!--Within 48 hours after placing the order, we start processing the order for international fullfilment. This includes export/import paperwork, quality checking, international logistics and everything in between. <br>
As soon as the process is started, we start incurring cost, and because of that, it would be very difficult for us to process full money refunds without a genuine reason. 
<br><br>
If you have a genuine reason for your request for your cancellation of order and refund request, we would certainly want to help you out. Please send your request with order details to care@miracas.com<br>
